# Coffee-Machine
interactive coffee machine made using python

This is my first python program. The program will ask the user what type of coffee they want, will ask for the payment, and then
will produce the drink if enough payment is provided. Excess payment will be refunded and the resources of the coffee machine will be used 
according to the drink that is made. Insufficient resources will result in the requested drink not being made. Type "report" to see 
the machine's resources. Type "done" to turn the coffee machine off.
